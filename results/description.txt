Memcached Test Cases: 
* Test memcached for computations
Fibonacci without memcached
Fibonacci with memcached (avoid recomputations)
* Test memcached for data store - applicable to db / web
Load content from disk
Load content from cache
* Test memcached as a layer for datastore/web application
Load content from mysql db
Load content from cache
* Results:
In all cases, performance with memcached was faster as expectedâ€¦ 
Instead of recompute, do a cache lookup
Instead of load from slow HD, load from cache
Instead of load from slow DB on disk, load from cache
